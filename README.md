# What's this? 

Here are some signed addons which are either too special or don't seem to have drawn enough attenion on AMO for me to consider actively listing them there. 

Still, since rarely someone ask for something that matches, I'll keep this repo as backup/reference. 

And maybe I'll re-add them to AMO if I think one of them might be worth it.
